   So, what I am wanting to do is help people enhance their wellbeing. .
   to help people live a full and fulfilling life. I've been learning about
   things like human potential,. emotional wellbeing, . mindfulness, . and
   attaining higher states of awareness. . . I'm hoping you'll be interested
   in talking about some of these with me.

   # check for domain words first
   # keeping out the emotion domain keywords list because they are being caught
   # too broadly here
   a: ([~consciousness_words ~uniqueness_words emotion emotions feeling feelings

      ^rejoinder(PROMPT)
   a: ([^dont_agree() ~dontknow]) Certainly understandable if there's some
                               hesitation. |pause| Would you like to talk
                               about your potential, your feelings, or
                               higher states of consciousness? Those are the
                               things I have learned about.
